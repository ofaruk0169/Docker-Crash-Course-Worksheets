Deploying Docker containers on Azure
====================================

Aim
---

Use a commercial cloud container orchestration system to deploy a single-container application.

> Work through all of the commands introduced below to understand how they work and what they do.
> 
> Then move on to the challenge tasks at the end of the worksheet document.

Motivation
----------

Having developed an application locally and verified that it works as intended, the next step is to deploy it to a suitable cloud provider. We work through the steps required for this in the worksheet, eventually sending a request to our app running in the cloud.

Requirements
------------

Ensure you have an Azure subscription. You can get started with an [Azure free account](https://aka.ms/AA8r2pj).

Overview[](https://docs.docker.com/cloud/aci-integration/#overview)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Docker Azure Integration enables developers to use native Docker commands to run applications in Azure Container Instances (ACI) when building cloud-native applications. This integration allows cloud developers to quickly run applications using the Docker CLI or VS Code extension, and to switch seamlessly from local development to cloud deployment.

The Docker Command Line Interface (CLI) allows these additional functionalities to simplify deployments to Azure:
 
-   Easily log into Azure
-   Set up an ACI context in one Docker command allowing you to switch from a local context to a cloud context and run applications quickly and easily
-   Simplify single container and multi-container application development using the Compose specification, allowing a developer to invoke fully Docker-compatible commands seamlessly for the first time natively within a cloud container service (we'll move on to this capability later)

Run Docker containers on ACI[](https://docs.docker.com/cloud/aci-integration/#run-docker-containers-on-aci)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Docker not only runs containers locally, but also enables developers to seamlessly deploy Docker containers on ACI using `docker run` or deploy multi-container applications defined in a Compose file using the `docker compose up` command.

The following sections contain instructions on how to deploy your Docker containers on ACI.

### Log into Azure[](https://docs.docker.com/cloud/aci-integration/#log-into-azure)

Run the following command to log into Azure:

```
 docker login azure
```

This opens your web browser and prompts you to enter your Azure login credentials. If the Docker CLI cannot open a browser, it will fall back to the [Azure device code flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-device-code) and lets you connect manually. Note that the [Azure command line](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/) login is separated from the Docker CLI Azure login.

Alternatively, you can log in without interaction (typically in scripts or continuous integration scenarios), using an Azure Service Principal, with `docker login azure --client-id xx --client-secret yy --tenant-id zz`

> **Note**
>
> Logging in through the Azure Service Provider obtains an access token valid for a short period (typically 1h), but it does not allow you to automatically and transparently refresh this token. You must manually re-login when the access token has expired when logging in with a Service Provider.

You can also use the `--tenant-id` option alone to specify a tenant, if you have several ones available in Azure.

### Create an ACI context[](https://docs.docker.com/cloud/aci-integration/#create-an-aci-context)

After you have logged in, you need to create a Docker context associated with ACI to deploy containers in ACI. Creating an ACI context requires an Azure subscription, a [resource group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal), and a region. For example, let us create a new context called `myacicontext`:

```
 docker context create aci myacicontext

```

This command automatically uses your Azure login credentials to identify your subscription IDs and resource groups. You can then interactively select the subscription and group that you would like to use. If you prefer, you can specify these options in the CLI using the following flags: `--subscription-id`, `--resource-group`, and `--location`.

If you don't have any existing resource groups in your Azure account, the `docker context create aci myacicontext` command creates one for you. You don't have to specify any additional options to do this.

After you have created an ACI context, you can list your Docker contexts by running the `docker context ls` command:

### Run a container[](https://docs.docker.com/cloud/aci-integration/#run-a-container)

Now that you've logged in and created an ACI context, you can start using Docker commands to deploy containers on ACI.

There are two ways to use your new ACI context. You can use the `--context` flag with the Docker command to specify that you would like to run the command using your newly created ACI context.

```
 docker --context myacicontext run -p 80:80 nginx

```

Or, you can change context using `docker context use` to select the ACI context to be your focus for running Docker commands. For example, we can use the `docker context use` command to deploy an Nginx container:

```
 docker context use myacicontext

```

```
 docker run -p 80:80 nginx

```

After you've switched to the `myacicontext` context, you can use `docker ps` to list your containers running on ACI.

In the case of the demonstration Nginx container started above, the result of the ps command will display in column "PORTS" the IP address and port on which the container is running. For example, it may show `52.154.202.35:80->80/tcp`, and you can view the Nginx welcome page by browsing `http://52.154.202.35`.

To view logs from your container, run:

```
 docker logs <CONTAINER_ID>

```

To execute a command in a running container, run:

```
 docker exec -t <CONTAINER_ID> COMMAND

```

To stop and remove a container from ACI, run:

```
 docker stop <CONTAINER_ID>

```

```
 docker rm <CONTAINER_ID>

```

You can remove containers using `docker rm`. To remove a running container, you must use the `--force` flag, or stop the container using `docker stop` before removing it.

> **Note**
>
> The semantics of restarting a container on ACI are different to those when using a local Docker context for local development. On ACI, the container will be reset to its initial state and started on a new node. This includes the container's filesystem so all state that is not stored in a volume will be lost on restart.

Running Compose applications[](https://docs.docker.com/cloud/aci-integration/#running-compose-applications)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also deploy and manage multi-container applications defined in Compose files to ACI using the `docker compose` command. All containers in the same Compose application are started in the same container group. Service discovery between the containers works using the service name specified in the Compose file.

> Name resolution between containers is achieved by writing service names in the `/etc/hosts` file that is shared automatically by all containers in the container group.


1.  Ensure you are using your ACI context. You can do this either by specifying the `--context myacicontext` flag or by setting the default context using the command `docker context use myacicontext`.

2.  Run `docker compose up` and `docker compose down` to start and then stop a full Compose application.

By default, `docker compose up` uses the `docker-compose.yaml` file in the current folder. You can specify the working directory using the --workdir flag or specify the Compose file directly using `docker compose --file mycomposefile.yaml up`.

You can also specify a name for the Compose application using the `--project-name` flag during deployment. If no name is specified, a name will be derived from the working directory.

Containers started as part of Compose applications will be displayed along with single containers when using `docker ps`. Their container ID will be of the format: `<COMPOSE-PROJECT>_<SERVICE>`. These containers cannot be stopped, started, or removed independently since they are all part of the same ACI container group. You can view each container's logs with `docker logs`. You can list deployed Compose applications with `docker compose ls`. This will list only compose applications, not single containers started with `docker run`. You can remove a Compose application with `docker compose down`.

> **Note**
>
> The current Docker Azure integration does not allow fetching a combined log stream from all the containers that make up the Compose application.

Updating applications[](https://docs.docker.com/cloud/aci-integration/#updating-applications)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From a deployed Compose application, you can update the application by re-deploying it with the same project name: `docker compose --project-name PROJECT up`.

Updating an application means the ACI node will be reused, and the application will keep the same IP address that was previously allocated to expose ports, if any. ACI has some limitations on what can be updated in an existing application (you will not be able to change CPU/memory reservation for example), in these cases, you need to deploy a new application from scratch.

Updating is the default behavior if you invoke `docker compose up` on an already deployed Compose file, as the Compose project name is derived from the directory where the Compose file is located by default. You need to explicitly execute `docker compose down` before running `docker compose up` again in order to totally reset a Compose application.

Releasing resources[](https://docs.docker.com/cloud/aci-integration/#releasing-resources)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Single containers and Compose applications can be removed from ACI with the `docker prune` command. The `docker prune` command removes deployments that are not currently running. To remove running depoyments, you can specify `--force`. The `--dry-run` option lists deployments that are planned for removal, but it doesn't actually remove them.

```
 ./bin/docker --context acicontext prune --dry-run --force

```

Exposing ports[](https://docs.docker.com/cloud/aci-integration/#exposing-ports)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Single containers and Compose applications can optionally expose ports. For single containers, this is done using the `--publish` (`-p`) flag of the `docker run` command : `docker run -p 80:80 nginx`.

For Compose applications, you must specify exposed ports in the Compose file service definition:

```
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"

```

> **Note**
>
> ACI does not allow port mapping (that is, changing port number while exposing port). Therefore, the source and target ports must be the same when deploying to ACI.
>
> All containers in the same Compose application are deployed in the same ACI container group. Different containers in the same Compose application cannot expose the same port when deployed to ACI.

By default, when exposing ports for your application, a random public IP address is associated with the container group supporting the deployed application (single container or Compose application). This IP address can be obtained when listing containers with `docker ps` or using `docker inspect`.

### DNS label name[](https://docs.docker.com/cloud/aci-integration/#dns-label-name)

In addition to exposing ports on a random IP address, you can specify a DNS label name to expose your application on an FQDN of the form: `<NAME>.region.azurecontainer.io`.

You can set this name with the `--domainname` flag when performing a `docker run`, or by using the `domainname` field in the Compose file when performing a `docker compose up`:

```
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx
    domainname: "myapp"
    ports:
      - "80:80"

```

> **Note**
>
> The domain of a Compose application can only be set once, if you specify the `domainname` for several services, the value must be identical.
>
> The FQDN `<DOMAINNAME>.region.azurecontainer.io` must be available.



# Try Deploying a Docker Compose App

We can now run multiple containers on ACI using Docker Compose. With the ACI integration, we now have the ability to run compose commands from the docker cli against ACI. Let's do that next.

Clone a Code Repository
------------------------

Here is a simple Python Flask application that logs timestamps to a Redis database. Clone the git repository to your local machine.

Open up a terminal on your local machine and run the following git command to clone the repository to your local development machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/pmckeetx/timestamper.git
```

Build and Run Locally
---------------------

Make sure you are in the root directory for the timestamper project and follow the following steps to build the images and start the application with Docker Compose.

First we need to add your Docker ID to the image in our docker-compose.yml file. Open the `docker-compose.yml` file in an editor and replace `<<username>>` with your Docker ID.

Next, we need to make sure we are using the local Docker context.

```
$ docker context use default
```

Now we can build and start our application using docker-compose.

```
$ docker-compose up --build
Building frontend
Step 1/7 : FROM python:3.7-alpine
 ---> 6ca3e0b1ab69
Step 2/7 : WORKDIR /app
...
frontend_1  |  * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
frontend_1  |  * Restarting with stat
frontend_1  |  * Debugger is active!
frontend_1  |  * Debugger PIN: 622-764-646
```

Docker will build our timestamper image and then run the Redis database and our timestamper containers.

Navigate to http://localhost:5000 and click the Timestamp! button a couple of times.

Compose on ACI
--------------

Now let's run our application on ACI using the new docker compose integration.

We'll first need to push our image to Docker Hub so ACI can pull the image and run it. Run the following command to push your image to your Docker Hub account.

```
$ docker-compose push
Pushing frontend (pmckee/timestamper:latest)...
The push refers to repository [docker.io/pmckee/timestamper]
6e899582609b: Pushed
...
50644c29ef5a: Layer already exists
latest: digest: sha256:3ce2607f101a381b36beeb0ca1597cce9925d17a0f826cac0f7e0365386a3042 size: 2201
```

> NOTE: like yesterday, if you are working on an M1/M2 Mac, then you will need to build the image with `buildx` using the `--platform` option to set an `amd` architecture. You can run `docker buildx ...` separately now to do this, and push the new image to your account.

Now that our image is on Hub, we can use compose to run the application on ACI.

First let's create and switch to a new ACI context.

```
$ docker context create aci myacicomposecontext
$ docker context use myacicomposecontext
```

Remember, to see a list of contexts and which is being used, you can run the list contexts command.

```
$ docker context list
```

Okay, now that we are using the ACI context, let's start our application in the cloud.

```
$ docker compose up
[+] Running 3/3
 ⠿ timestamper     Created
 ⠿ frontend        Done
 ⠿ backend         Done
```

Let's verify that our application is up and running. To get the IP address of our frontend, let's list our running containers.

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID           IMAGE                COMMAND             STATUS              PORTS

timestamper_frontend       pmckee/timestamper
Running             40.71.234.128:5000->5000/tcp

timestamper_backend         redis:alpine
Running
```

Copy the IP address and port listed above and paste into your favorite browser.

![Azure aci using docker cli 5](https://www.docker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/azure-aci-using-docker-cli-5.png)

Let's take a look at the logs for our Redis container.

```
$ docker logs timestamper_backend
1:C 13 Jul 2020 18:21:12.044 # oO0OoO0OoO0Oo Redis is starting oO0OoO0OoO0Oo
...
1:M 13 Jul 2020 18:21:12.046 # Server initialized
1:M 13 Jul 2020 18:21:12.047 * Ready to accept connections
```

That is a Redis container running in ACI! Pretty cool.

After you play around a bit, you can take down the compose application by running compose down.

```
$ docker compose down
```


Environment variables[](https://docs.docker.com/cloud/aci-integration/#environment-variables)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When using `docker run`, you can pass the environment variables to ACI containers using the `--env` flag. For Compose applications, you can specify the environment variables in the Compose file with the `environment` or `env-file` service field, or with the `--environment` command line flag.

Health checks[](https://docs.docker.com/cloud/aci-integration/#health-checks)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can specify a container health checks using either the `--healthcheck-` prefixed flags with `docker run`, or in a Compose file with the `healthcheck` section of the service.

Health checks are converted to ACI `LivenessProbe`s. ACI runs the health check command periodically, and if it fails, the container will be terminated.

Health checks must be used in addition to restart policies to ensure the container is then restarted on termination. The default restart policy for `docker run` is `no` which will not restart the container. The default restart policy for Compose is `any` which will always try restarting the service containers.

Example using `docker run`:

```
 docker --context acicontext run -p 80:80 --restart always --health-cmd "curl http://localhost:80" --health-interval 3s  nginx

```

Example using Compose files:

```
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    deploy:
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:80"]
      interval: 10s

```

Bootcamp Challenge Tasks
========================

Now you have just enough knowledge to try to complete the following. This will be a good test of the previous few days' work.

1. Deploy your single-container Flask application from Week 6 Session 2, to an Azure container.

2. Deploy your Docker compose multi-service application from Week 6 Session 3, to an Azure Container Instance group of containers. You will need to set up a new docker context to run the deployment.

3. (Not easy.) Review the GitHub Actions practical from Week 7 Session 1 and work out how to automate a Docker Compose application Build-Push-Deploy pipeline using an Actions build script.
